These are configs and scripts I use whenever I have to setup a new macOS device
(or for some reason subject myself to actually using Linux on the desktop through things other than WSL/SSH).

Some things go way back, some are brand new and,
other things are ~~stolen~~ nicely borrowed from the likes of [@saagarjha](https://github.com/saagarjha/dotfiles/).
